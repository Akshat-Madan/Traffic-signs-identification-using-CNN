A deep learning project that classifies German traffic signs in real time using a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This system can accurately identify road signs from images, a core capability used in autonomous vehicle perception and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems).

## 📖 Overview

Traffic sign recognition is a critical component of autonomous driving systems. This project trains a CNN from scratch on the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)** dataset to classify traffic signs into their respective categories with high accuracy.

**Key highlights:**
- Custom CNN architecture built and trained with TensorFlow/Keras
- Preprocessing pipeline using `skimage` for image normalisation and augmentation
- Model evaluation using `sklearn` metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix)
- Deployed as an interactive web application via the `app/` module

## 🎬 Demo

> Launch the app and upload a traffic sign image to get an instant prediction.

```bash
python app/app.py

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The CNN is designed to balance accuracy and computational efficiency:

```
Input (32×32×3)
    ↓
Conv2D (32 filters, 3×3, ReLU) → BatchNorm → MaxPooling
    ↓
Conv2D (64 filters, 3×3, ReLU) → BatchNorm → MaxPooling
    ↓
Conv2D (128 filters, 3×3, ReLU) → BatchNorm → MaxPooling
    ↓
Flatten
    ↓
Dense (512, ReLU) → Dropout (0.5)
    ↓
Dense (43, Softmax)   ← Output layer (43 classes)
```

- **Optimiser:** Adam
- **Loss Function:** Categorical Cross-Entropy
- **Regularisation:** Dropout + Batch Normalisation
- **Saved Model:** `traffic_sign_model.h5`

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above
- pip

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Akshat-Madan/Traffic-signs-identification-using-CNN.git
cd Traffic-signs-identification-using-CNN

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install tensorflow numpy scikit-image scikit-learn
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

### Run the Web App

```bash
python app/app.py
```

Then open your browser at `http://localhost:5000` and upload a traffic sign image to get a real-time prediction.

### Load the Pre-trained Model Directly

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
import numpy as np
from skimage import io, transform

# Load model
model = load_model('traffic_sign_model.h5')

# Preprocess image
img = io.imread('path/to/sign.png')
img = transform.resize(img, (32, 32))
img = np.expand_dims(img, axis=0)

# Predict
prediction = model.predict(img)
class_id = np.argmax(prediction)
print(f"Predicted class: {class_id}")
```

- [ ] Integrate data augmentation (rotation, zoom, brightness shifts) to improve robustness
- [ ] Experiment with transfer learning using pre-trained models (e.g., MobileNetV2, EfficientNet)
- [ ] Extend support to other international traffic sign datasets (US, UK, India)
- [ ] Add a real-time webcam/video stream inference pipeline using OpenCV
- [ ] Containerise the application with Docker for easy deployment
- [ ] Deploy to cloud (AWS / GCP / Azure) with a REST API endpoint
